== TODO

* create rake tasks for setting up blog (instead of renaming bunch of files as
  described in README)

* make blog easier configurable - move blog title and similar "constants" to
  configuration or localizations
  
* implement <i>error page</i> and <i>not found</i> page

* update to Rails 3.1

* <b>Multiple designs</b> - admin can add multiple designs, users can switch between
  them
